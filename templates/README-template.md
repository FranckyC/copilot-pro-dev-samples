PRO TIP:

For commands, use the `code syntax`. For button labels, page names, dialog names, etc. as they appear on the screen, use **Bold**. Don't use "click", use "select" or "use".

As tempting as it may be, don't just use images to describe the steps. Let's be as inclusive as possible and think about accessibility.
